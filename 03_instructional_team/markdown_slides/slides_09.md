eQTL study:
 - $y_i$ : (normalized) gene expression (for a particular gene and tissue)
 - eQTL summary statistics: $T=\left(T_1, T_2, \ldots T_m\right)$

# Challenges

  ![Sales Figure, w:800](./images/challenge.png)


-------

# Exercise: Colocalization vs LD

Consider a locus where:
- GWAS identifies a strong association with type 2 diabetes (lead SNP: A).
- An eQTL study in pancreatic islets finds a strong association with expression
  of gene X in the same region, but the lead eQTL SNP is different (lead SNP: B).

Question:
1. Why might the lead GWAS SNP and the lead eQTL SNP be different
   even if there is a shared causal variant?

---------

# Methods to Integrate GWAS and eQTL Data

- **Bayesian approaches** aim to identify shared causal variants contributes to both the disease outcome and gene expression variation.
  - **COLOC , eCAVIAR, GWAS-PW**.etc.
- **Frequentist-based methods:**
- Methods that impute gene expression based on a reference, and then associate imputed expression with the trait:
  - **PrediXcan and TWAS**
- Integration methods based on Mendelian randomization:
  - **SMR, SMR-multi**, etc.
- Overlapping pattern:
  - **Simple Sum2**


------

# COLOC


- Calculates posterior probability for 5 cases (from H0 to H4)
  $$
  P\left(H_h \mid D\right) \propto \sum_{S \in S_h} P(D \mid S) P(S)
  $$


  ![bg right:50% w:500](./images/coloc.png)


- Prior probabilities: Set at SNP level - typically $\mathrm{P}_1=P_2=10^{-4}$ for association with one trait, and $P_{12}=10^{-6}$ for colocalization (shared association).


-------
# Extension of COLOC

- GWAS-PW (Pickrell et al. 2016):
  - Extends COLOC by empirically estimating priors from the genome-wide data for the five hypotheses.
  - Incorporates sample relatedness
  
  
- COLOC2 (Dobbyn et al. 2017):
  - Uses estimated proportions in GWAS-PW as priors (or optionally, coloc default or user-specified priors) in the calculation of the posterior probability.
  - For a locus with multiple independent eQTL signals, adopting **a forward stepwise conditional analysis for the eQTL study**.
  - For a gene with $k$ independent eQTLs, they run $k$ colocalization models.

------


# Application

- GWAS signature for IREB2 Colocalizes with the Conditional eQTL signature.


  ![bg right:60% w:600](./images/coloc_example.png)
  
------

# Pros and Cons of COLOC2

- Advantages:
  - Quick computation by Approximate Bayes Factor without iterative computation scheme (such as Markov Chain Monte Carlo) is required.
  - Distinguished evidence for non-colocalization.(H0-H4)

- Limitations:
  - Single-causal-variant assumption per trait within the region (can mislead in polygenic/allelic-heterogeneity settings).
  - Conditional analysis can be costly when extending to multiple signals or larger regions.


--------

# SuSiE-COLOC

- SuSiE is a fine-mapping framework to distinguish multiple signals for a given trait, and is more computationally efficient than the forward stepwise conditional analysis.
- SuSiE outputs a $95 \%$ credible set selecting a subset of L signals with inferred causal SNPs.
- If $L_1$ and $L_2$ signals are selected for trait1 and trait2, respectively, we run COLOC $L_1 \times L_2$ times on all possible pairs of signals between the traits.

---------

# ECAVIAR
(Hormozdiari et al. 2016)

- Simultaneously performing fine-mapping for GWAS and eQTL studies by considering almost all combinations of causal status between SNPs
- Estimate the posterior probability that the same variant is causal in both studies :

$$
\mathrm{P}\left(c_i^{(\mathrm{p})}=1, c_i^{(\mathrm{e})}=1 \mid S^{(\mathrm{p})}, S^{(\mathrm{e})}\right)=\mathrm{P}\left(c_i^{(\mathrm{p})}=1 \mid S^{(\mathrm{p})}\right) \times \mathrm{P}\left(c_i^{(\mathrm{e})}=1 \mid S^{(\mathrm{e})}\right).
$$

  - $c_i^{(p)}$ and $c_i^{(e)}$: indicator that SNP $i$ is causal in the GWAS (phenotype) study and eQTL study, respectively.
  - $S^{(p)}$ and $S^{(e)}$ : vector of $Z$-scores from the GWAS and eQTL study, respectively. 

-------

# Pros and Cons of ECAVIAR

Advantage:
- Higher true positive rate compared to COLOC when multiple variants are causal in a locus with low LD.

Limitations:
- Computation can be very long when number of SNPs is huge
- Imposes an assumption on the maximum number of causal SNPs in a locus (six)
- The posterior probability of colocalization will be averaged across several variants in high LD, resulting in ambiguous colocalization conclusions.


-------

# Extensions to Multi-Trait Colocalization

- **Moloc** evaluates all possible configurations of shared vs. distinct causal variants across traits.
  - Computationally intense: number of configurations $=2^T-1$ (for T traits)
  - Good when you want explicit posterior probabilities for all trait-sharing scenarios
- **Hyprcoloc** uses a greedy algorithm to group traits that share a causal variant.
  - Prioritizes traits that colocalize strongly first, then expands to others
  - Hyprcoloc is suited for large numbers of traits (e.g., >10).


------

# Further Issues

- eCAVIAR evaluates multiple causal configurations but is computationally intensive with many SNPs.
- SuSiE-COLOC reduces complexity but still requires $\mathrm{L}_1 \times \mathrm{L}_2$ coloc runs.
- Reduced power when there is high LD
- Few formal corrections for multiple hypotheses across loci.
- Posterior probabilities (e.g., PPH4) must be interpreted with caution in genome-wide scans.
- Adjusting priors using false positive report probability (FPRP) to control for multiple testing.


------

# Simple Sum

- A frequentist integration method that combines GWAS and eQTL signals within a locus.
- Particularly powerful in regions with high LD and allelic heterogeneity (multiple causal variants).
- The extension Simple Sum 2 (SS2) is designed to control type I error under a composite null, correct for multiple testing, and handle meta-analysis / sample relatedness.

--------
  
# Chi-square ($\chi^2$) Distribution: Quick Review

- Fact from probability: if $Z \sim N(0,1)$, then **$Z^2 \sim \chi^2_1$**.
- Consider **independent** $Z_1, \dots, Z_k \sim N(0,1)$.
  - Define a statistic $S = \sum_{j=1}^k Z_j^2$.
  - Then $S \sim \chi^2_k$, a chi-square distribution with **$k$ degrees of freedom**.
- In practice, SNP Z-scores within a locus are **correlated** because of LD.

------

# Weighted $\chi^2$ Distributions: Quick Review

- Let $Z = (Z_1,\dots,Z_k)^\top \sim N(0,\Sigma)$, where $\Sigma$ is the LD (correlation) matrix.

- Consider the statistic $S = \sum_{j=1}^k Z_j^2.$
 
- Using the eigenvalues $f_1,\dots,f_k$ of the LD matrix $\Sigma$, we can write
  $$
  S \;\overset{d}{\approx}\; \sum_{j=1}^k f_j \chi^2_{1,j},
  $$
  a **weighted sum of independent $\chi^2_1$ variables**.

- Intuition: each eigenvalue $f_j$ represents how much variation comes
  from one “independent direction” of the LD structure; larger $f_j$
  give more weight in the sum.
---------

# Quadratic Forms: Quick Review

- Many region- or gene-level test statistics can be written as a **quadratic form**  
    $S = \sum_{i} a_{i,j}Z_{i}Z_{j}=Z^\top A Z$, for some symmetric matrix $A$ (e.g. weights on SNPs).
  - For example, $A=I$. 
  
- In practice, software computes the eigenvalues and then uses this weighted $\chi^2$ distribution to obtain the **p-value** under the null (i.e., $Z \sim N(0,\Sigma)$):
  $$
  S = Z^\top A Z \;\overset{d}{\approx}\; \sum_{j=1}^m d_j \chi^2_{1,j}.
  $$
- $T$ behaves like a **weighted sum of independent $\chi^2_{1}$ variables**,  with weights are the eigenvalues $d_j$ of matrix $\Sigma^{1/2} A \Sigma^{1/2}$.
---

# Simple Sum 

[Gong*, Wang*, Xiao*, et al., 2019. PLOS Genetics.]
- Dichotomized eQTL evidence (threshold $\tau$ ):
  $$
  S S=\frac{1}{\sum_{j=1}^m I\left(\left|T_j\right| \geq \tau\right)} \sum_{j=1}^m Z_j^2 I\left(\left|T_j\right| \geq \tau\right)-\frac{1}{\sum_{j=1}^m I\left(\left|T_j\right|<\tau\right)} \sum_{j=1}^m Z_j^2 I\left(\left|T_j\right|<\tau\right)
  $$

# Simple Sum 

- $\boldsymbol{S S}=\sum_{\boldsymbol{j}} Z_j^2\left[\frac{\boldsymbol{T}_{\boldsymbol{j}}^2-\frac{\sum_{\boldsymbol{j}} \boldsymbol{T}_{\boldsymbol{j}}^2}{\boldsymbol{m}}}{\left(\sum_{\boldsymbol{j}} \boldsymbol{T}_{\boldsymbol{j}}^2-\frac{\sum_{\boldsymbol{j}} \boldsymbol{T}_{\boldsymbol{j}}^2}{\boldsymbol{m}}\right)^2}\right]=Z^{\prime} \boldsymbol{A} Z, ~ A=\operatorname{diag}\left(a_j\right), a_j=\left[\frac{T_j^2-\frac{\sum_j T_j^2}{m}}{\left(\sum_j T_j^2-\frac{\sum_j T_j^2}{m}\right)^2}\right].$


  ![Sales Figure, w:1000](./images/ss_type1.png)

--------


# Simple Sum 2

- Stage 1: Formally test eQTLs by $\sum_{j=1}^m T_j^2$.

- Under the null of no eQTLs ( $H_{01}$ and $H_{03}$ ), $\sum_{j=1}^m T_j^2 \sim \sum_{j=1}^m f_j \chi_1^2$, where $f_j^{\prime} s$ are the eigenvalues of $\Sigma$ (LD matrix).

- Stage 2: Perform the Simple Sum test $\sum_j Z_j^2\left[\frac{T_j^2-\frac{\sum_j T_j^2}{m}}{\left(\sum_j T_j^2-\frac{\sum_j T_j^2}{m}\right)^2}\right]$.

- The type I error rate for a single test under composite null hypothesis is controlled at $\alpha$.
- Bounded by the maximum type $I$ error rates for the stage 1 and the stage 2 test.

-------


# Complex Data Scenarios

- Many gene-tissue tests: extend to multiple gene-tissue pairs and control the family-wise error rate (FWER) across tests (e.g., Bonferroni correction).
- Meta-analysis with related individuals: combine sub-studies by modeling the covariance of SS2 test statistics to account for relatedness.
- Sample overlap: explicitly account for overlap/relatedness between GWAS and eQTL cohorts, adjusting cross-study correlations when performing inference.



--------

# LocusFocus 

(https://locusfocus.research.sickkids.ca/)

- SS2 is implemented in this web-based tool, which enables integration of GWAS summary statistics with any secondary SNP-level dataset such as eQTL, mQTL, or other phenotypic associations from GWAS. 

- The tool is developed to **conduct set/gene-based testing, colocalization analysis** and **visualization of signals**.

- The eQTL summary statistics from GTEx V8 are made available for selection within the web server to test colocalization with tissues and genes. 

- COLOC2 colocalization testing is also available.

# Discussion: What can colocalization tell us (and not tell us)?

- Suppose colocalization analysis suggests a shared signal between a GWAS trait
  and an eQTL for gene X in a relevant tissue.

Questions:
1. What are **limitations** of relying only on colocalization to infer causality?
2. What additional data or analyses would you want before declaring gene X causal?

<!--

# Mendelian Randomization (MR)

- Mendelian randomization (MR): "the use of genetic variants as instrumental variables to investigate the effects of modifiable risk factors for disease".

- For instance, one trait (phenotype or disease) might be affected by confounding or reverse causation rather than a conventional observational variable. 

- MR aims to provide a statistical frame to verify the causality between locus and phenotype and exclude pleiotropy.

----

# Core Assumptions of MR

1. The genetic instrument is associated with the exposure.
2. The instrument is independent of confounders.
3. The instrument affects the outcome only through the exposure (no alternative pathways / horizontal pleiotropy).

  ![bg right:50% w:550](./images/MR.png)

-----

# Statistical Strategies for MR

- General idea: compare **effect sizes ( $\boldsymbol{\beta}$ )** or **$\mathbf{p}$-values** for the **same variant(s)** across exposure and outcome GWAS.

- Example estimator (ratio method for a single instrument):
$\beta_{ratio}=\frac{\beta_{exposure}}{\beta_{outcome}}$

- Multi-instrument frameworks include **two-stage least squares (2SLS)** and generalized IV models.

- Robust estimators to address pleiotropy and heterogeneity: inverse-variance weighted (IVW), MR-Egger, median/mode-based, limited information maximum likelihood, control-function approaches.


------

# MR Software \& References (Getting Started)

- Tools: GSMR (GCTA), TwoSampleMR (R), MR-PRESSO, MR-LDP (LD-aware), plus IVW/MR-Egger implementations in common packages.

- Tutorial: Bioconductor vignette for GMRP (summary-data MR workflows).

# Application for MUC4/MUC20 Locus 

![Sales Figure, w:550](./images/muc20.png)
![bg right:50% w:700](./images/muc20_2.png)

------

# Step 1 - Preprocessing \& QC

- Goal: ensure **correct genomic positions** and a clean, analyzable **GWAS summary**.

- Key actions
  - Confirm genome build; **liftOver** if needed and reconcile positions.
  - QC: HWE, sample/variant filters, sex discrepancy, population stratification, etc. 

- Helpful resources/tools: **UCSC liftOver**, widely used to correct genomic position mismatches between the GWAS summary file and the reference panel. 
   - Other options: build converters, tracklayer, Assembly Converter, NCBI Remap, CrossMap.

-------

# Step 2 - Visualization of GWAS Summary

- Purpose: inspect the genome-wide signal distribution and QC.

- Plots to generate
  - Manhattan plot (-log10 p vs. position)
  - QQ plot (observed vs. expected p -values; genomic inflation)
  
- Can be completed with tools such as qqman (R) and other plotting packages.


------

# Step 3 - Downstream pGWAS Analyses

- Choose analyses based on **trait architecture** and **heterogeneity** assumptions.
- If the architecture is **homogeneous**:
  - Perform single-variant pGWAS or $\chi^2$-based tests to associate genes/pathways with variants.
  - Use MAGMA, GSEA/GO frameworks for gene-/set-based results.

- If heterogeneous (multiple signals, diverse mechanisms):
- Apply network/pathway analyses to uncover biological context.
- Integrate **PRS analyses** and genetic risk estimates if individual-level or summary-level data allow.
- When diverse results across multiple independent datasets exist, conduct a **meta-analysis**.

# Introduction to Rare Variation and Sequencing Studies

--------------

# Rare Variation in the Genome

- GWAS typically focus on common variants (minor allele frequency $\geq 5 \%$ ).
- **Sequencing studies** (including whole-exome and whole-genome sequencing) enable the discovery of **rare and low-frequency** variants.
- The vast majority of genetic variants in the human genome are **rare**.
- **De novo mutations** are the rarest type of genetic variation: germline variants present in a child but absent in both parents.


------

# Why study rare variation?

- Rare variants can play an important role in disease, especially for traits strongly influenced by natural selection.
- Mendelian diseases represent an extreme example of the impact of rare variants.
- In autism spectrum disorders (ASD), de novo mutations are estimated to contribute to about 25-30\% of cases.
- Rare variants may have comparatively smaller effects on more late-onset diseases (e.g., type 2 diabetes, Alzheimer's disease) and on quantitative traits (e.g., cardiometabolic phenotypes).
- There is an inverse relationship between effect size and allele frequency, so rare variants can have large effects and may be particularly clinically actionable.
