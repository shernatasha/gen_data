# What You Will Learn Today


- **Quality Control (QC) essentials for GWAS**: why QC matters and common filters.
- **Hands-on GWAS walkthrough (1 hour)**: end-to-end tutorial from input to association output.
- **From discovery to validation**: replication criteria and why signals may not replicate.

# Quality-Control (QC)

- QC is mandatory in genetic studies.

- Sample quality depends on DNA source (e.g., blood vs. buccal), handling, and storage.

- Error profiles **vary by platform**.

- **Random** genotyping error → lower power, no systematic bias.

- **Non-random** error → can inflate **false positives**.

   - For example, case/control imbalances (different batches, labs, technologies).

- Avoid convenience controls that don’t match cases.

-------

# Genotype Calling

- Then vs. now: Early studies relied on manual inspection of electrophoresis gels; modern studies use fully automated pipelines.

- How calls are made: Algorithms use allele-specific intensity signals for each SNP and assign the most likely genotype.

- Platform specificity: Different genotyping platforms employ their own calling algorithms, tuned to their chemistry and probe design.


------

# Genotype Calling

- Historically: manual calls from gels; now automated from allele intensity data.
- Algorithms infer genotypes for each SNP using two-allele intensities.
- Different platforms use different callers.


-------

# Typical Quality Filters

- GWAS include hundreds of thousands of SNPs and thousands of samples; even a 1\% error rate yields a substantial number of SNPs and samples with errors.
- Remove SNPs and samples with excessive **missing or failed calls**.
- Extensive QC is performed prior to association testing to prevent non-random errors from inflating false positives.

----

# Filtering Steps

- **MAF \& missingness**: Drop SNPs with MAF < 5\% (study-dependent) and remove SNPs or samples with >~5\% missing calls.
- Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium: **Exclude SNPs showing HWE departures** (e.g., $P_{\text {HWE }}<0.001$), which often indicate genotyping error.
- Mendelian consistency: In pedigree data, remove SNPs with excess **Mendelian errors**.
- **Relatedness checks**: Identify cryptic relatives or duplicates; unmodeled relatedness inflates test statistics and false positives.
- After QC, evaluate the dataset with a quantile-quantile (Q-Q) plot to confirm that the test statistic distribution matches expectation (no residual inflation).


------

# Q-Q plots


- Q-Q plots can diagnose systematic inflation or deflation of test statistics (e.g., uncorrected population stratification, batch effects).
- If most variants are truly null $\rightarrow$ points lie on the $45^{\circ}$ line.

- Important caveat: Many traits are polygenic; widespread weak effects can cause mild upward deviation even with good QC.

# Replication vs. Non-replication

- After a new association is reported, it should be validated in an independent cohort.
- Genotype the same SNP in an independent sample and test the association again.
- Replication criteria (very strict):
  - The SNP attains statistical significance ( $\alpha = 0.05$ ).
  - Same genetic model is supported (additive, dominant, recessive, etc.).
  - Effect direction matches the discovery (risk $\leftrightarrow$ protective).
  - The replication study has adequate power (typically $80-90\%$ ).
- Note: Failure to replicate does not automatically invalidate the original finding.

------

# Why a Result Might Not Replicate

- **False positive** in the discovery study.

- **Insufficient power** in the replication sample.

- The tested SNP is a **tag** (in LD with the causal variant); **LD differences** across populations can break the signal.

- **Context dependence**: effect sizes can vary with covariates (e.g., age), study phenotype definition, or other design differences.

# What's Next

- **What GWAS teaches us**: polygenicity, effect sizes, and cross-ancestry considerations.
- **Post-GWAS fine-mapping basics**: Regular approaches and Bayesian approaches.
